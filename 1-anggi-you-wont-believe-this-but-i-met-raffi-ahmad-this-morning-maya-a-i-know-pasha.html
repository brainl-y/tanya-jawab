    Among the biggest sports in the world are the Olympic Games. They began im Greece a long time ago. They were held every four years at Olympia. At that time, only mau n participed in the games. Women could not even watch them in stadium. <br />
    At the first Olympic Games there was only one event, a running race. Later games had more events: long jump, javelin throwing, boxing, and chariot racing. The only prize the winner received was a crown of leaves. But it was a great honor to win. <br />
    When the Romans conquered Greece, they continued to hold the Olympic Games. But they started to give winners big prizes. Unfortunely, people began to cheat, so the Romans Emperor Theodosius stopped the games. <br />

Runners carry the Olympic flame from Greece all the way to the host country for this purpose. <br />
